##Description: A File Handling Utility is a software tool designed to perform operations on files, such as creating, reading, writing, modifying, organizing, and managing them efficiently. These utilities ensure smooth interaction between users and stored data, whether on local devices or cloud storage.
Key Functions:

File Organization – Includes renaming, moving, copying, and deleting files.
Data Security & Recovery – Enables encryption, backup, and recovery of files.
Format Conversion – Converts files between different formats (e.g., TXT to PDF).
Batch Processing – Performs actions on multiple files at once for efficiency.
I am used visual studio code IDE for this project.
